Cat Slideshow
 
What it does:
	A simple display of cat images, one by one
	Every x seconds, a new cat image will show up.
	cat images are taken from some online database (don't want a huge file)
	
How to do it:
	look into Flickr's API and search system, grab cat photos off there
	Frame will be relatively simple
	Develop some way of smoothly transitioning between photos
		fading?
		scrolling?
		
What I'll Learn:
	mainly how to deal with online APIs, authentication of service, search queries, wrappers, etc.
	graphics stuff will be image related/possible reiteration and improvement of graphics

	Notes:
		it's using my API key in the url already...
		per_page=20 is the key, change that if needed
		everything else should probably stay the same
